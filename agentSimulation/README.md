Practice agent based simulation that shows the spread of muscle wilt (MW) in a body over 10 years using a 15 x 15 array of cells.
This program also includes the Youthazeen (YZ) drug, which makes cells immune to MW and also spreads between cells.
If a healthy (NA or not afflicted) cell is next to a MW cell in a cardinal direction, the healthy cell has a 50% chance of becoming a MW cell.
If a NA cell is next to a YZ cell, there is a 60% chance that the YZ begins tendriling to the NA cell, giving it a 60% immunity to MW cells and becoming fully immune once the year is over.
This program displays the array of cells at years 1, 5, and 10 as well as the amount of NA, MW, and YZ cells in that year.
At the end of the 10 year period, the program displays the average MW cells and the variance of the MW cells.
